                 <p>This edtion of the Inscrptions of RRoman Cyrenaica (20200 is being published tomark the 102nd birthday of Joyce Reynolds, 
                     of Newnham College Cambridge, the principal author.
                     In 1948 she was based at the British School at Rome, from where she started a series of regular visits to Libya, 
                     to study the inscriptions of the Roman period. She worked initially in Tripolitania: her epigraphic corpus, the Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania, 
                     written with John Ward-Perkins, was published in 1952, and an enhanced edition was published online in 2009: 
                     <ref target="http://inslib.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/">Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania (2009)</ref>. 
                     In 1951 she first visited Cyrenaica, and since then has collected and studied the inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica, working with local archaeologists 
                     and others from Italy, France, the U.K. and the U.S.A.. She continued to visit Libya almost every year until 2008, 
                     and assembled materials for a corpus of over 2000 inscriptions from Roman Cyrenaica. Nearly a third of these have never previously been published, 
                     while others have only appeared in versions which can be very much improved, and better understood, as a result of re-reading. 
                     The majority are accompanied by photographs collected by Joyce Reynolds and her colleagues 
                     (in particular Elizabeth Rosenbaum-Alföldi and Hafed Walda), or given to her by the Libyan Department of Antiquities. </p>
                 <p>In preparing this edition, the team has drawn on experience gained in publishing the online corpora of the 
                     <ref target="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/">Inscriptions of Aphrodisias</ref>, and <ref target="https://iospe.kcl.ac.uk">Ancient Inscriptions of the Northern Black Sea</ref>. 
                     The new corpus is presented as a series of documents; but as part of the project we have created and published 
                     the <ref target="https://www.slsgazetteer.org/">Heritage Gazetteer of Libya</ref>, to which the corpus refers. We have worked in close co-operation with t
                     the <ref target="https://igcyr.unibo.it/">Inscriptions of Greek Cyrenaica/Greek Verse Inscriptions of Cyrenaica </ref>project, to our mutual benefit. </p>
