                 <p>The transcriptions of the texts were made and organised by Joyce Reynolds; they were entrusted by her for publication to Gabriel Bodard and 
                     Charlotte Roueché. Bodard then oversaw the writing up of the texts in EpiDoc; this served as a traing for many students (see below). 
                     Further texts were added from pubications by Reynolds. Over the same period Bodard scanned some 3000 photographs; while some were clearly associated with the relevant texts, others were not. 
                     Once the texts were in digital form, and searchable, it became possible to identify many more photographs. Pietro Liuzzo did the fundamental work,
                     followed by Roueché.</p>
