MedCyprus: A Digital Corpus of Painted Greek Inscriptions from Medieval Cyprus (10th – 13th centuries AD)
====

MedCyprus constitutes the first comprehensive corpus of Greek painted ecclesiastical inscriptions for a defined geographical region -- Cyprus -- within the Byzantine world. It is certainly the first time that custom digital technologies -- EpiDoc and EFES -- are used for the publication of a corpus of Cypriot epigraphic material of the Byzantine and Medieval periods. Making use of these digital tools in order to achieve the objectives of MedCyprus is the best strategy to ensure not only that its outcomes are widely disseminated and easily accessible for free, but also that the corpus itself may continue to be improved and expanded in years to come. MedCyprus constitutes a significant addition to a constantly growing number of initiatives making use of digital technologies with the purpose of recording, analysing, and promoting the multi-faceted cultural heritage of Cyprus over its long history.

EFES: EpiDoc Front-End Services
====

**EFES is a delivery, search and browse platform that can be set up and customized for an individual EpiDoc XML-based project with only minimal training and technical skill on the part of a project team.**
The authors of Kiln plan to offer advanced, follow-up training workshops for students already familiar with EpiDoc, but lacking further technical skills, with a view to empowering them to create and manage all stages of their digital publication, from modelling to indexing to publishing online.

EFES is a fork of the **Kiln** publication plaform, described below.

Kiln
----

Kiln is an open source multi-platform framework for building and deploying
complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML. It brings together
various independent software components into an integrated whole that provides
the infrastructure and base functionality for such sites.

Kiln is developed and maintained by a team at the King's Digital Lab (KDL), King’s College London. 
Over the past years and versions, Kiln has been used to generate more than 50 websites
which have very different source materials and customised
functionality. It has been adapted to work on a variety of flavours of
TEI and other XML vocabularies, and has been used to publish data held
in relational databases.
