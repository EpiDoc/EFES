              <p>In 1948 Joyce Reynolds, of Newnham College Cambridge, then based at the British
                School at Rome, started a series of regular visits to Libya, to study the
                inscriptions of the Roman period. She worked initially in Tripolitania: her
                epigraphic corpus, the <i>Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania</i>, written with John
                Ward-Perkins, was published in 1952, and remains the authoritative work. In 1951 she
                first visited Cyrenaica, and has worked since then on the inscriptions of Roman
                Cyrenaica, working with local archaeologists and others from Italy, France, the U.K.
                and the U.S.A.. She has continued to visit Libya almost every year since then, and
                has assembled materials for a corpus of nearly 2000 inscriptions from Roman Cyrenaica.
                Nearly a third of these have never previously been published, while others have only
                appeared in versions which can be very much improved, and better understood, as a
                result of re-reading. The collection is made up of transcriptions, and illustrations
                for about half the texts; the bulk of the remainder are illustrated in photographs
                held only in the archives of the Libyan Department of Antiquities at Cyrene.</p>

              <p>The
                Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica project has been funded by the Leverhulme Trust, to
                publish this material as an online corpus; the team will be drawing on experience
                gained in publishing the online corpus of the <a href="http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/" class="ext" title="External website">Inscriptions
                  of Aphrodisias</a>. Images held in Cambridge, Rome and Cyrene
                will be scanned to illustrate the collection. The new corpus will be presented as a
                series of documents; but it will also link to an online map of Roman Cyrenaica,
                being prepared as part of the Pleiades project, at the University of North Carolina,
                Chapel Hill. Material collected by Reynolds and her colleagues will be used to map
                ancient sites on that map, with a fullness which was not possible within the
                necessary limitations of its predecessor, the <i>Barrington Atlas of the Greek and
                  Roman World</i>.</p>
